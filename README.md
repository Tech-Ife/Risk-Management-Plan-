# DHA Enterprise Inc. – ISO 27001-Compliant Risk Management Plan

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive **ISO/IEC 27001-compliant Risk Management Plan** for **DHA Enterprise Inc. (DHAEI)**, a software development company headquartered in Oshawa, Ontario. The plan identifies critical risks to DHAEI’s hybrid infrastructure, including both on-premises systems and cloud workloads hosted on **AWS** and **Rackspace**.

I performed a **full risk assessment and treatment process**, developed a **Statement of Applicability (SOA)**, and mapped each security control to relevant ISO/IEC 27001 requirements. This project was completed as part of my cybersecurity portfolio at Lighthouse Labs, to demonstrate my skills in governance, risk, and compliance (GRC).



##  Summary 
- Conducted a **risk assessment** based on the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.
- **Identified and classified assets, vulnerabilities, and threats** (e.g., ransomware, data breaches, and service outages).
- Developed a **Statement of Applicability (SOA)**, linking controls to ISO 27001 provisions.
- Designed **risk treatment strategies** such as MFA implementation, EDR deployment, encryption policies, and disaster recovery planning.
- Delivered a **clear roadmap for risk prioritization**, ensuring alignment with international best practices and NIST SP 800-53 guidelines.



##  Methodology
I followed the **ISO/IEC 27001 Risk Management Framework** with these steps:
1. **Asset Identification** – Mapped servers, endpoints, and cloud resources across DHAEI’s branches and HQ.
2. **Threat and Vulnerability Analysis** – Evaluated high-impact risks including ransomware attacks and unauthorized data access.
3. **Risk Evaluation** – Scored risks based on impact, likelihood, and severity.
4. **Risk Treatment** – Recommended mitigations such as encrypted backups, strict AD group policies, and redundancy for critical systems.
5. **Statement of Applicability** – Documented implemented and pending controls, ensuring compliance with ISO 27001 and industry standards.



##  Outcomes
- Strengthened **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** posture for DHAEI.
- Delivered a **risk management framework** that supports regulatory compliance and operational resilience.
- Provided **actionable recommendations** that align with ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-53 controls.
- Built a structured plan that **executes security at all organizational levels** – from technicians to executives.



##  Skills Gained
- ISO/IEC 27001 risk assessment and compliance alignment.  
- Cloud and on-premises security analysis (AWS, Rackspace, Windows Server).  
- Risk scoring, mitigation planning, and security governance.  
- Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) documentation, including Statements of Applicability (SOA).  
- Threat modeling and risk prioritization for critical business infrastructure.  
- Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP) to ensure service resilience.  
- Development of executive-level cybersecurity recommendations with actionable roadmaps.
